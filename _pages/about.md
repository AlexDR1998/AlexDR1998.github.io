I am a PhD student on the MAC-MIGS CDT at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie at the intersection of applied mathematics, developmental biology and machine learning. I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Richard Blythe](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~rblythe3/), [Dr Linus Schumacher](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/linus-schumacher) and [Dr Tibor Antal](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~antal/index.html). I am currently focused on applying machine learning and PDEs to modelling spatiotemporal pattern formation in complex biological systems. I am also working on adversarial safety of image generators.

I am also an active musician, involved in various projects across different genres.
