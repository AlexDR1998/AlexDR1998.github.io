I am a PhD student on the MAC-MIGS CDT at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie at the intersection of applied mathematics, computational physics and machine learning. I am jointly supervised by Prof. Richard Blythe, Dr Linus Schumacher and Dr Tibor Antal.


I am also an active musician, involved in various projects across different genres.
