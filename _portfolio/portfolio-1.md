Neural cellular automata are a class of models capable of learning local interactions that give a desired emergent behaviour. Originaly developed in the context of [growing images from single pixels](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/), we extend this to learn dynamics from time series of images: [https://github.com/AlexDR1998/NCA](https://github.com/AlexDR1998/NCA).
