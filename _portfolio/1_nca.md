Neural cellular automata are a class of models capable of learning local interactions that give a desired emergent behaviour. Originaly developed in the context of [growing images from single pixels](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/), we extend this to learn dynamics from time series of images, and from Turing patterning in reaction-diffusion PDEs: [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011589](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011589).
