Modern machine learning is a fast developing and diverse field, but it's theoretical basis can be quickly understood by those with physics backgrouds. I organised and ran a workshop teaching the fundamentals of machine learning to physics PhD students, as well as [practical examples](https://github.com/AlexDR1998/highlands_conference_ml_workshop/tree/master) built on the JAX library.
